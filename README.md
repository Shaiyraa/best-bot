# About the project
Best Bot a.k.a. Alish 2.0 is a custom made discord bot, created for a guild in Black Desert Online, but ready to serve many guilds who are interested. I decided to build this project, because the leaders of the guild struggled to keep track of their members' progress in game, as well as to manage various guild events. 
Now they have access to many useful stats like counting average gearscore of the guild or even for certain character classes. 
Planning an event is almost effortless, as the bot also reminds people to sign up on its own and puts them into pre-created platoons, freeing the staff's time for more important matters. 

# Member Profiles
Each member has their own profile, where they can edit their character's stats. This way officers and leaders can easily check where are the weak points of everyone.

# Platoons and PA's
Alish 2.0 allows officers to create custom-sized platoons and PA groups, where then they can assign members to. 

# Statistics
Leaders can see stats regarding the amount of each character class in the guild, average gearscore for platoons, classes as well as the entire guild. The bot also presents profiles in gear brackets using QuickChart API.

# Event creation
There are three types of events to choose from at the moment: "nodewar", "siege", and "guildevent". Officers can choose the date and hour of future event, as well as max. number of people who can attend - if more want to sign up, they will be notified that signups are full. Bot also allows for choosing if the event is mandatory, which is a preparation for future feature of counting attendance on mandatory events.
